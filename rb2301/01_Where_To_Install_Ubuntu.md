# 1.1&emsp;Dual Boot
| | |
| --- | --- |
| Purpose | Allows Ubuntu to be installed alongside Windows 11 (instructions for Mac not provided). |
| Why this? | Dual booting is a good option for performance while keeping some functionalities of Windows. Although Ubuntu may occasionally stop becoming accessible after Windows Updates, it can be fixed with the bootable stick. |
| Backup Data! | **ATTENTION!** Always back up your drive because it is **very easy** to accidentally erase the entire disk with one wrong setting while installing. |
| Easier Install | Consider investing in a **Ubuntu-certified PC** for your undergraduate robotics degree. Such PCs are less likely to run into problems when dual booting. See if your computer is Ubuntu-certified in https://ubuntu.com/certified/laptops. Some brands like Lenovo, HP, and Dell have better native support for Linux so you are less likely to run into trouble. |

# 1.2&emsp;Single Boot

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Purpose | Replaces the current operating system with Ubuntu. |
| Why this? | Single booting is a good option if Windows is not required, particularly if you do not need the full functionalities of Microsoft Office or other Windows software. |
| Backup Data! | **ATTENTION!** Always back up your drive because it is **very easy** to accidentally erase the entire disk. |
| Easier Install | Consider investing in a **Ubuntu-certified PC** for your undergraduate robotics degree. See above. |

# 1.3&emsp;Oracle VirtualBox
| | |
| --- | ---|
| Purpose | Virtualization with VirtualBox. VMWare can also be used but instructions are not provided. |
| Why this? | VirtualBox is slightly slower than dual boot and single boot and can have issues with the simulation software and robot communication. However, it may be the only alternative for users with incompatible hardware. |
