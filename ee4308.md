# 1&emsp;Install Oracle VirtualBox 6.1 on Windows Host
If you have Ubuntu 22.04 LTS on your system as a virtual machine or boot, ignore this section.
About 200MB of Wi-Fi is required for this section.
This course requires Ubuntu 22.04 because ROS2 Humble requires Ubuntu 22.04.  
The steps are meant for installing the VirtualBox virtual machine on a Windows 10 or 11 system. 
The instructions are not meant for Apple users, although it may be similar.
1. Go to https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_6_1 to download the VirtualBox device. If your PC is on Windows, click `Windows hosts`.
2. Open the installer and click `Yes` or `Next` until the installer completes. You may encounter some information about missing Python dependencies, which can be ignored.
3. If using Windows, search for and click `Core Isolation` in the start menu. Turn off `Memory Integrity`, and close the window.
4. If using Windows, search for and click `Turn Windows features on or off` in the start menu. Look for and uncheck `Virtual Machine Platform`, click `OK`, and restart Windows.
5. Proceed to the next section.

# 2&emsp;Mounting Ubuntu 22.04 LTS in Oracle VirtualBox
About 7GB of Wi-Fi is required for this section.
  
  ---
1. Go to https://releases.ubuntu.com/jammy/ and download `64-bit PC (AMD64) desktop image` (`.iso`) which should be the first option. This is the **Ubuntu 22.04 Desktop Image**. This file size is approximately 4.7 GB.
